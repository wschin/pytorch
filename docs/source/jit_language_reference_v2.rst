TorchScript Language Reference
==============================

This TorchScript Language reference manual describes the syntax and core semantics of the TorchScript language.
TorchScript is a statically typed subset of Python language. This document attempts to explain the supported features of
Python in TorchScript and also how the language diverges from regular Python. Any features of Python not mentioned in
this reference are not part of TorchScript. TorchScript focuses specifically on the features of Python that are needed to
represent neural network models in PyTorch.

   * - ``A*``
     - indicates a regular expression where term A is repeated zero or more times

Type System
~~~~~~~~~~~
TorchScript is a statically typed subset of Python. The largest difference between TorchScript and the full Python language is that TorchScript only supports a small set of types that are needed to express
neural net models.

TorchScript Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The TorchScript type system consists of ``TSType`` and ``TSModuleType`` as defined below.

::

    TSAllType ::= TSType | TSModuleType
    TSType    ::= TSMetaType | TSPrimitiveType | TSStructuralType | TSNominalType

``TSType`` represents the majority of TorchScript types that are composable and can be used in TorchScript type annotations.
``TSType`` refers to any of the following:

* Meta Types, e.g., ``Any``
* Primitive Types, e.g., ``int``, ``float``, ``str``
* Structural Types, e.g., ``Optional[int]`` or ``List[MyClass]``
* Nominal Types (Python classes), e.g., ``MyClass`` (user-defined), ``torch.tensor`` (builtin)

``TSModuleType`` represents ``torch.nn.Module`` and its subclasses. It is treated differently from ``TSType`` because its type schema is inferred partly from the object instance and partly from the class definition.
As such, instances of a ``TSModuleType`` may not follow the same static type schema. ``TSModuleType`` cannot be used as a TorchScript type annotation or be composed with ``TSType`` for type safety considerations.

Meta Types
^^^^^^^^^^

Meta types are so abstract that they are more like type constraints than concrete types.
Currently TorchScript defines one meta-type, ``Any``, that represents any TorchScript type.

``Any`` Type
""""""""""""

The ``Any`` type represents any TorchScript type. ``Any`` specifies no type constraints, thus there is no type checking on ``Any``.
As such it can be bound to any Python or TorchScript data types (e.g., int, TorchScript ``tuple``, or an arbitrary Python class that is not scripted).

::

    TSMetaType ::= "Any"

where

* ``Any`` is the Python class name from the typing module, therefore usage of the ``Any`` type requires from ``typing import Any``
* Since ``Any`` can represent any TorchScript type, the set of operators allowed to operate on values of this type on Any is limited.

Operators supported for ``Any`` type
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

* assignment to data of ``Any`` type
* binding to parameter or return of ``Any`` type
* ``x is``, ``x is not`` where ``x`` is of ``Any`` type
* ``isinstance(x, Type)`` where ``x`` is of ``Any`` type
* data of ``Any`` type is printable
* Data of ``List[Any]`` type may be sortable if the data is a list of values of the same type ``T`` and that ``T`` supports comparison operators

**Compared to Python**


``Any`` is the least constrained type in the TorchScript type system. In that sense, it is quite similar to
``Object`` class in Python. However, ``Any`` only supports a subset of the operators and methods that are supported by Object.

Design notes
""""""""""""

When we script a PyTorch module, we may encounter data that are not involved in the execution of the script, nevertheless has to be described
by a type schema. It is not only cumbersome to describe static types for unused data (in the context of the script) but also may lead to unnecessary
scripting failures. ``Any`` is introduced to describe the type of the data where precise static types are not necessary for compilation.

**Example**

This example illustrates how ``Any`` can be used to allow the second element of the tuple parameter to be of any type. This is possible
because ``x[1]`` is not involved in any computation that requires knowing its precise type.

.. testcode::

    import torch

    from typing import Tuple
    from typing import Any

    @torch.jit.export
    def inc_first_element(x: Tuple[int, Any]):
        return (x[0]+1, x[1])

    m = torch.jit.script(inc_first_element)
    print(m((1,2.0)))
    print(m((1,(100,200))))

The example will generate the following output, where the second element of the tuple is of ``Any`` type
thus can bind to multiple types, e.g., (1, 2.0) binds a float type to ``Any`` as in ``Tuple[int, Any]``,
whereas ``(1, (100, 200))`` binds a tuple to ``Any`` in the second invocation.

.. testoutput::

    (2, 2.0)
    (2, (100, 200))

**Example**

We can use ``isinstance`` to dynamically check the type of the data annotated as ``Any`` type.

.. testcode::

    import torch
    from typing import Any

    def f(a:Any):
        print(a)
        return (isinstance(a, torch.Tensor))

    ones = torch.ones([2])
    m = torch.jit.script(f)
    print(m(ones))

The above example produces the following output

.. testoutput::

     1
     1
    [ CPUFloatType{2} ]
    True

Primitive Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Primitive TorchScript types represent types that represent a single type of value and go with a single pre-defined
type name.

::

    TSPrimitiveType ::= "int" | "float" | "double" | "complex" | "bool" | "str" | "None"

Structural Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Structural types are types that are structurally defined without a user-defined name (unlike nominal types),
such as ``Future[int]``. Structural types are composable with any ``TSType``.

::

    TSStructuralType ::=  TSTuple | TSNamedTuple | TSList | TSDict |
                        TSOptional | TSFuture | TSRRef

    TSTuple          ::= "Tuple" "[" (TSType ",")* TSType "]"
    TSNamedTuple     ::= "namedtuple" "(" (TSType ",")* TSType ")"
    TSList           ::= "List" "[" TSType "]"
    TSOptional       ::= "Optional" "[" TSType "]"
    TSFuture         ::= "Future" "[" TSType "]"
    TSRRef           ::= "RRef" "[" TSType "]"
    TSDict           ::= "Dict" "[" KeyType "," TSType "]"
    KeyType          ::= "str" | "int" | "float" | "bool" | TensorType | "Any"

where

* ``Tuple``, ``List``, ``Optional``, ``Union``, ``Future``, ``Dict`` represent Python type class names defined in module ``typing``. Therefore before using these type names, one must import them from ``typing`` (e.g., ``from typing import Tuple)``.
* ``namedtuple`` represents Python class  ``collections.namedtuple`` or ``typing.NamedTuple`` .
* ``Future`` and ``RRef`` represent Python classes  ``torch.futures``, ``torch.distributed.rpc``.

**Compared to Python**


* Apart from being composable with TorchScript types, these TorchScript structural types often support a common subset of the operators and methods of their Python counterparts.

**Example**

This example uses ``typing.NamedTuple`` syntax:

.. testcode::

    import torch
    from typing import NamedTuple
    from typing import Tuple

    class MyTuple(NamedTuple):
        first: int
        second: int

    def inc(x: MyTuple) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        return (x.first+1, x.second+1)

    t = MyTuple(first=1, second=2)
    scripted_inc = torch.jit.script(inc)
    print("TorchScript:", scripted_inc(t))

.. testoutput::

    TorchScript: (2, 3)

This example uses ``collections.namedtuple`` syntax:

.. testcode::

    import torch
    from typing import NamedTuple
    from typing import Tuple
    from collections import namedtuple

    _AnnotatedNamedTuple = NamedTuple('_NamedTupleAnnotated', [('first', int), ('second', int)])
    _UnannotatedNamedTuple = namedtuple('_NamedTupleAnnotated', ['first', 'second'])

    def inc(x: _AnnotatedNamedTuple) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        return (x.first+1, x.second+1)

    m = torch.jit.script(inc)
    print(inc(_UnannotatedNamedTuple(1,2)))

.. testoutput::

    (2, 3)

**Example**

This example illustrates a common mistake of annotating structural types, i.e., not importing the composite type
classes from the ``typing`` module.

::

    import torch

    # ERROR: Tuple not recognized because not imported from typing
    @torch.jit.export
    def inc(x: Tuple[int, int]):
        return (x[0]+1, x[1]+1)

    m = torch.jit.script(inc)
    print(m((1,2)))

Running the above codes yields the following scripting error. The remedy is to add ``from typing import Tuple``.

::

    File "test-tuple.py", line 5, in <module>
        def inc(x: Tuple[int, int]):
    NameError: name 'Tuple' is not defined

Nominal Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nominal TorchScript types are Python classes. They are called nominal because these types are declared with a custom
name and are compared using class names. Nominal classes are further classified into the following categories:

::

    TSNominalType ::= TSBuiltinClasses | TSCustomClass | TSEnum

Among them, ``TSCustomClass`` and ``TSEnum`` must be compilable to TorchScript IR (as enforced by the type-checker).

Builtin Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Builtin nominal types are Python classes whose semantics are built into the TorchScript system, such as tensor types.
TorchScript defines the semantics of these builtin nominal types, and often supports only a subset of the methods or
attributes of its Python class definition.

::

    TSBuiltinClass ::= TSTensor | "torch.device" | "torch.Stream" | "torch.dtype" |
                       "torch.nn.ModuleList" | "torch.nn.ModuleDict" | ...
    TSTensor       ::= "torch.Tensor" | "common.SubTensor" | "common.SubWithTorchFunction" |
                       "torch.nn.parameter.Parameter" | and subclasses of torch.Tensor


Special note on torch.nn.ModuleList and torch.nn.ModuleDict
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Although ``torch.nn.ModuleList`` and ``torch.nn.ModuleDict`` are defined as a list and dictionary in Python,
they behave more like tuples in TorchScript.

* In TorchScript, instances of ``torch.nn.ModuleList``  or ``torch.nn.ModuleDict`` are immutable.
* Code that iterates over ``torch.nn.ModuleList`` or ``torch.nn.ModuleDict`` is completely unrolled so that elements of ``torch.nn.ModuleList`` or keys of ``torch.nn.ModuleDict`` can be of different subclasses of ``torch.nn.Module``.

**Example**

::

    import torch

    @torch.jit.script
    class A:
        def __init__(self):
            self.x = torch.rand(3)

        def f(self, y: torch.device):
            return self.x.to(device=y)

    def g():
        a = A()
        return a.f(torch.device("cpu"))

    script_g = torch.jit.script(g)
    print(script_g.graph)

Custom Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike built-in classes, semantics of custom classes are user-defined and the entire class definition must be compilable to TorchScript IR and subject to TorchScript type-checking rules.

::

    TSClassDef ::= [ "@torch.jit.script" ]
                     "class" ClassName [ "(object)" ]  ":"
                        MethodDefinition |
                    [ "@torch.jit.ignore" ] | [ "@torch.jit.unused" ]
                        MethodDefinition

where

* Classes must be new-style classes (note that Python 3 supports only new-style classes, for Python 2.x new-style class is specified by subclassing from object)
* Instance data attributes are statically typed, and instance attributes must be declared by assignments inside the ``__init__()`` method
* Method overloading is not supported (i.e., cannot have multiple methods with the same method name)
* MethodDefinition must be compilable to TorchScript IR and adhere to TorchScript’s type-checking rules, (e.g., all methods must be valid TorchScript functions and class attribute definitions must be valid TorchScript statements)
* ``torch.jit.ignore`` and ``torch.jit.unused`` can be used to ignore the method or function that is not fully torchscriptable or should be ignored by the compiler

**Compared to Python**


TorchScript custom classes are quite limited compared to their Python counterpart.

* do not support class attributes
* do not support subclassing except for subclassing an interface type or object
* do not support method overloading
* must initialize all its instance attributes in  ``__init__()``; this is because TorchScript constructs a static schema of the class by inferring attribute types in ``__init__()``
* must contain only methods that satisfy TorchScript type-checking rules and are compilable to TorchScript IRs

**Example**

Python classes can be used in TorchScript if they are annotated with ``@torch.jit.script``, similar to how a TorchScript function would be declared:

::

    @torch.jit.script
    class MyClass:
        def __init__(self, x: int):
            self.x = x

        def inc(self, val: int):
            self.x += val


**Example**

A TorchScript custom class type must "declare" all its instance attributes by assignments in ``__init__()``. If an instance attribute is not defined in ``__init__()`` but accessed in other methods of the class, the class cannot be compiled as a TorchScript class, as shown in the following example:

::

    import torch

    @torch.jit.script
    class foo:
        def __init__(self):
            self.y = 1

    # ERROR: self.x is not defined in __init__
    def assign_x(self):
        self.x = torch.rand(2, 3)

The above class will fail to compile and issue the following error:

::

    RuntimeError:
    Tried to set nonexistent attribute: x. Did you forget to initialize it in __init__()?:
    def assign_x(self):
        self.x = torch.rand(2, 3)
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ <--- HERE

**Example**

In this example, a TorchScript custom class defines a class variable name, which is not allowed.

::

    import torch

    @torch.jit.script
    class MyClass(object):
        name = "MyClass"
        def __init__(self, x: int):
            self.x = x

    def fn(a: MyClass):
        return a.name

It leads to the following compile-time error:

::

    RuntimeError:
    '__torch__.MyClass' object has no attribute or method 'name'. Did you forget to initialize an attribute in __init__()?:
        File "test-class2.py", line 10
    def fn(a: MyClass):
        return a.name
            ~~~~~~ <--- HERE

Enum Type
^^^^^^^^^

Like custom classes, semantics of enum type are user-defined and the entire class definition must be compilable to TorchScript IR and adhere to TorchScript type-checking rules.

::

    TSEnumDef ::= "class" Identifier "(enum.Enum | TSEnumType)" ":"
                   ( MemberIdentifier "=" Value )+
                   ( MethodDefinition )*

where

* Value must be a TorchScript literal of type ``int``, ``float``, or ``str``, and must be of the same TorchScript type
* ``TSEnumType`` is the name of a TorchScript enumerated type. Similar to Python enum, TorchScript allows restricted ``Enum`` subclassing, that is, subclassing an enumerated is allowed only if it does not define any members.

**Compared to Python**


* TorchScript supports only ``enum.Enum``, but not other variations such as ``enum.IntEnum``, ``enum.Flag``, ``enum.IntFlag``, or  ``enum.auto``
* Values of TorchScript enum members must be of the same type and can only be of ``int``, ``float``, or ``str`` type, whereas Python enum members can be of any type
* Enums containing methods are ignored in TorchScript.

**Example**

::

    import torch
    from enum import Enum

    class Color(Enum):
        RED = 1
        GREEN = 2

    def enum_fn(x: Color, y: Color) -> bool:
        if x == Color.RED:
            return True
        return x == y

    m = torch.jit.script(enum_fn)

    print("Eager: ", enum_fn(Color.RED, Color.GREEN))
    print("TorchScript: ", m(Color.RED, Color.GREEN))

**Example**

The following example shows the case of restricted enum subclassing, where ``BaseColor`` does not define any member, thus can be subclassed by ``Color``.

::

    import torch
    from enum import Enum

    class BaseColor(Enum):
        def foo(self):
            pass

    class Color(BaseColor):
        RED = 1
        GREEN = 2

    def enum_fn(x: Color, y: Color) -> bool:
        if x == Color.RED:
            return True

        return x == y

    m = torch.jit.script(enum_fn)
    print("TorchScript: ", m(Color.RED, Color.GREEN))
    print("Eager: ", enum_fn(Color.RED, Color.GREEN))

TorchScript Module Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``TSModuleType`` is a special class type that is inferred from object instances created outside TorchScript. ``TSModuleType`` is named by the Python class of the object instance. The ``__init__()`` method of the Python class is not considered as a TorchScript method, so it does not have to comply with TorchScript’s type checking rules.

Since the type schema of module instance class is constructed directly from an instance object (created outside the scope of TorchScript), rather than inferred from ``__init__()`` like custom classes. It is possible that two objects of the same instance class type follow two different type schemas.

In this sense, ``TSModuleType`` is not really a static type. Therefore, for type safety considerations, ``TSModuleType`` cannot be used in a TorchScript type annotation or be composed with ``TSType``.

Module Instance Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TorchScript module type represents type schema of a user-defined PyTorch module instance.  When scripting a PyTorch module, the module object is always created outside TorchScript (i.e., passed in as parameter to ``forward``), The Python module class is treated as a module instance class, so the ``__init__()`` method of the Python module class is not subject to the type checking rules of TorchScript.

::

    TSModuleType ::= "class" Identifier "(torch.nn.Module)" ":"
                        ClassBodyDefinition

where

* ``forward()`` and other methods decorated with ``@torch.jit.export`` must be compilable to TorchScript IR and subject to TorchScript’s type checking rules

Unlike custom classes, only the forward method and other methods decorated with ``@torch.jit.export``  of the module type need to be compilable. Most notably, ``__init__()`` is not considered a TorchScript method. Consequently, module type constructors cannot be invoked within the scope of TorchScript. Instead, TorchScript module objects are always constructed outside and passed into ``torch.jit.script(ModuleObj)``.

**Example**

.. testcode::

    import torch

    class TestModule(torch.nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, v):
            super().__init__()
            self.x = v

        def forward(self, inc: int):
            return self.x + inc

    m = torch.jit.script(TestModule(1))
    print(f"First instance: {m(3)}")

    m = torch.jit.script(TestModule(torch.ones([5])))
    print(f"Second instance: {m(3)}")

.. testoutput::

    First instance: 4
    Second instance: tensor([4., 4., 4., 4., 4.])

This example illustrates a few features of module types:

*  The ``TestModule`` instance is created outside the scope of TorchScript (i.e., before invoking ``torch.jit.script``).
* ``__init__()`` is not considered to be a TorchScript method, therefore it does not have to be annotated and can contain arbitrary Python code. In addition, the ``__init__()`` method of an instance class cannot be invoked in TorchScript code.* Because ``TestModule`` instances are instantiated in Python, in this example, ``TestModule(2.0)`` and ``TestModule(2)`` create two instances with different types for its data attributes. ``self.x is of type ``float`` for ``TestModule(2.0)``, whereas ``self.y`` is of type ``int`` for ``TestModule(2.0)``.
* TorchScript automatically compiles other methods (e.g., ``mul()``) invoked by methods annotated via ``@torch.jit.export`` or ``forward()`` methods
* Entry-points to a TorchScript program are either ``forward()`` of a module type or functions annotated as ``torch.jit.script`` or methods annotated as ``torch.jit.export``

**Example**

The following shows an incorrect usage of module type. Specifically, this example invokes the constructor of ``TestModule`` inside the scope of TorchScript.

.. testcode::

    import torch

    class TestModule(torch.nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, v):
            super().__init__()
            self.x = v

        def forward(self, x: int):
            return self.x + x

    class MyModel:
        def __init__(self, v: int):
            self.val = v

        @torch.jit.export
        def doSomething(self, val: int) -> int:
            # error: should not invoke the constructor of module type
            myModel = TestModule(self.val)
            return myModel(val)

    # m = torch.jit.script(MyModel(2)) # Results in below RuntimeError
    # RuntimeError: Could not get name of python class object

.. _type_annotation:


Type Annotation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since TorchScript is statically typed, programmers need to annotate types at *strategic points* of TorchScript code so that every local variable or
instance data attribute has a static type, and every function and method has a statically typed signature.

When to annotate types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In general, type annotations are only needed in places where static types cannot be automatically inferred, such as parameters or sometimes return types to
methods or functions. Types of local variables and data attributes are often automatically inferred from their assignment statements. Sometimes, an inferred type
may be too restrictive, e.g., ``x`` being inferred as ``NoneType`` through assignment ``x = None``, whereas ``x`` is actually used as an ``Optional``. In such
cases, type annotations may be needed to overwrite auto inference, e.g., ``x: Optional[int] = None``. Note that it is always safe to type annotate a local variable
or data attribute even if its type can be automatically inferred. But the annotated type must be congruent with TorchScript’s type checking.

When a parameter, local variable, or data attribute is not type annotated and its type cannot be automatically inferred, TorchScript assumes it to be a
default type of ``TensorType``, ``List[TensorType]``, or ``Dict[str, TensorType]``.

Annotate function signature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since parameter may not be automatically inferred from the body of the function (including both functions and methods), they need to be type annotated,
otherwise they assume the default type ``TensorType``.

TorchScript supports two styles for method and function signature type annotation:

* **Python3-style** annotates types directly on the signature. As such, it allows individual parameters be left unannotated (whose type will be the default type of ``TensorType``) , or the return type be left unannotated (whose type will be automatically inferred).


::

    Python3Annotation ::= "def" Identifier [ "(" ParamAnnot* ")" ] [ReturnAnnot] ":"
                                FuncOrMethodBody
    ParamAnnot        ::= Identifier [ ":" TSType ] ","
    ReturnAnnot       ::= "->" TSType

Note that using Python3 style, the type of ``self`` is automatically inferred and should not be annotated.

* **Mypy style** annotates types as a comment right below the function/method declaration. In the My-Py style, since parameter names do not appear in the annotation, all parameters have to be annotated.


::

    MyPyAnnotation ::= "# type:" "(" ParamAnnot* ")" [ ReturnAnnot ]
    ParamAnnot     ::= TSType ","
    ReturnAnnot    ::= "->" TSType

**Example 1**

In this example, ``a`` is not annotated and assumes the default type of ``TensorType``, ``b`` is annotated as type ``int``, and the return type is not
annotated and is automatically inferred as type ``TensorType`` (based on the type of the value being returned).

::

    import torch

    def f(a, b: int):
        return a+b

    m = torch.jit.script(f)
    print("TorchScript:", m(torch.ones([6]), 100))

**Example 2**

The following code snippet gives an example of using mypy style annotation. Note that parameters or return values must be annotated even if some of
them assume the default type.

::

    import torch

    def f(a, b):
        # type: (torch.Tensor, int) → torch.Tensor
        return a+b

    m = torch.jit.script(f)
    print("TorchScript:", m(torch.ones([6]), 100))


Annotate variables and data attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In general, types of data attributes (including class and instance data attributes) and local variables can be automatically inferred from assignment statements.
Sometimes, however, if a variable or attribute is associated with values of different types (e.g., as ``None`` or ``TensorType``), then they may need to be explicitly
type annotated as a *wider* type such as ``Optional[int]`` or ``Any``.

Local variables
"""""""""""""""
Local variables can be annotated according to Python3 typing module annotation rule, i.e.,

::

    LocalVarAnnotation ::= Identifier [":" TSType] "=" Expr

In general, types of local variables can be automatically inferred. In some cases, however, programmers may need to annotate a multi-type for local variables
that may be associated with different concrete types. Typical multi-types include ``Optional[T]`` and ``Any``.

**Example**

::

    import torch

    def f(a, setVal: bool):
        value: Optional[torch.Tensor] = None
        if setVal:
            value = a
        return value

    ones = torch.ones([6])
    m = torch.jit.script(f)
    print("TorchScript:", m(ones, True), m(ones, False))

Instance data attributes
""""""""""""""""""""""""
For ``ModuleType`` classes, instance data attributes can be annotated according to Python3 typing module annotation rules. Instance data attributes can be annotated (optionally) as final
via ``Final``.

::

    "class" ClassIdentifier "(torch.nn.Module):"
    InstanceAttrIdentifier ":" ["Final("] TSType [")"]
    ...

where ``InstanceAttrIdentifier`` is the name of an instance attribute and ``Final`` indicates that the attribute cannot be re-assigned outside
of ``__init__`` or overridden in subclasses.

**Example**

In this example, ``a`` is not annotated and assumes the default type of ``TensorType``, ``b`` is annotated as type ``int``, and the return type is not
annotated and is automatically inferred as type ``TensorType`` (based on the type of the value being returned).

::

    import torch

    class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):
        offset_: int

    def __init__(self, offset):
        self.offset_ = offset

    ...



Type Annotation APIs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``torch.jit.annotate(T, expr)``
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
This API annotates type ``T`` to an expression ``expr``. This is often used when the default type of an expression is not the type intended by the programmer.
For instance, an empty list (dictionary) has the default type of ``List[TensorType]`` (``Dict[TensorType, TensorType]``) but sometimes it may be used to initialize
a list of some other types. Another common use case is for annotating the return type of ``tensor.tolist()``. Note, however that it cannot be used to annotate
the type of a module attribute in `__init__`; ``torch.jit.Attribute`` should be used for this instead.

**Example**

In this example, ``[]`` is declared as a list of integers via ``torch.jit.annotate`` (instead of assuming ``[]`` to be the default type of ``List[TensorType]``).

::

    import torch
    from typing import List

    def g(l: List[int], val: int):
        l.append(val)
        return l

    def f(val: int):
        l = g(torch.jit.annotate(List[int], []), val)
        return l

    m = torch.jit.script(f)
    print("Eager:", f(3))
    print("TorchScript:", m(3))


See :meth:`torch.jit.annotate` for more information.

.. _expressions:


Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following section describes the grammar of expressions that are supported in TorchScript.
It is modeled after `the expressions chapter of the Python language reference <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html>`_.

Arithmetic Conversions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are a number of implicit type conversions that are performed in TorchScript:


* a ``Tensor`` with a ``float`` or ``int`` datatype can be implicitly converted to an instance of ``FloatType`` or ``IntType`` provided that it has a size of 0, and does not have ``require_grad`` set to ``True`` and will not require narrowing.
* instances of ``StringType`` can be implicitly converted to ``DeviceType``
* the above implicit conversion rules can be applied to instances of ``TupleType`` to produce instances of ``ListType`` with the appropriate contained type


Explicit conversions can be invoked using the ``float``, ``int``, ``bool``, ``str`` built-in functions
that accept primitive data types as arguments and can accept user-defined types if they implement
``__bool__``, ``__str__``, etc.


Atoms
^^^^^
Atoms are the most basic elements of expressions.

::

    atom      ::=  identifier | literal | enclosure
    enclosure ::=  parenth_form | list_display | dict_display

Identifiers
"""""""""""
The rules that dictate what is a legal identifer in TorchScript are the same as
their `Python counterparts <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#identifiers>`_.

Literals
""""""""

::

    literal ::=  stringliteral | integer | floatnumber

Evaluation of a literal yields an object of the appropriate type with the specific value
(with approximations applied as necessary for floats). Literals are immutable, and multiple evaluations
of identical literals may obtain the same object or distinct objects with the same value.
`stringliteral <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals>`_,
`integer <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#integer-literals>`_, and
`floatnumber <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#floating-point-literals>`_
are defined in the same way as their Python counterparts.

Parenthesized Forms
"""""""""""""""""""

::

    parenth_form ::=  '(' [expression_list] ')'

A parenthesized expression list yields whatever the expression list yields. If the list contains at least one
comma, it yields a ``Tuple``; otherwise, it yields the single expression inside the expression list. An empty
pair of parentheses yields an empty ``Tuple`` object (``Tuple[]``).

List and Dictionary Displays
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

::

    list_comprehension ::=  expression comp_for
    comp_for           ::=  'for' target_list 'in' or_expr
    list_display       ::=  '[' [expression_list | list_comprehension] ']'
    dict_display       ::=  '{' [key_datum_list | dict_comprehension] '}'
    key_datum_list     ::=  key_datum (',' key_datum)*
    key_datum          ::=  expression ':' expression
    dict_comprehension ::=  key_datum comp_for

Lists and dicts can be constructed by either listing the container contents explicitly or providing
instructions on how to compute them via a set of looping instructions (i.e. a *comprehension*). A comprehension
is semantically equivalent to using a for loop and appending to an ongoing list the expression of the comprehension.
Comprehensions implicitly create their own scope to make sure the items of the target list do not leak into the
enclosing scope. In the case that container items are explicitly listed, the expressions in the expression list
are evaluated left-to-right. If a key is repeated in a ``dict_display`` that has a ``key_datum_list``, then, the
resultant dictionary uses the value from the rightmost datum in the list that uses the repeated key.

Primaries
^^^^^^^^^

::

    primary ::=  atom | attributeref | subscription | slicing | call


Attribute References
""""""""""""""""""""

::

    attributeref ::=  primary '.' identifier


``primary`` must evaluate to an object of a type that supports attribute references that has an attribute named
``identifier``.

Subscriptions
"""""""""""""

::

    subscription ::=  primary '[' expression_list ']'


The primary must evaluate to an object that supports subscription. If it is a ``List`` , ``Tuple``, or ``str``,
the expression list must evaluate to an integer or slice. If it is a ``Dict``, the expression list must evaluate
to an object of the same type as the key type of the ``Dict``. If the primary is a ``ModuleList``, the expression
list must be an ``integer`` literal. If the primary is a ``ModuleDict``, the expression must be a ``stringliteral``.


Slicings
""""""""
A slicing selects a range of items in a ``str``, ``Tuple``, ``List`` or ``Tensor``. Slicings may be used as
expressions or targets in assignment or ``del`` statements.

::

    slicing      ::=  primary '[' slice_list ']'
    slice_list   ::=  slice_item (',' slice_item)* [',']
    slice_item   ::=  expression | proper_slice
    proper_slice ::=  [expression] ':' [expression] [':' [expression] ]

Slicings with more than one slice item in their slice lists can only be used with primaries that evaluate to an
object of type ``Tensor``.


Calls
"""""

::

    call          ::=  primary '(' argument_list ')'
    argument_list ::=  args [',' kwargs] | kwargs
    args          ::=  [arg (',' arg)*]
    kwargs        ::=  [kwarg (',' kwarg)*]
    kwarg         ::=  arg '=' expression
    arg           ::=  identifier


`primary` must desugar or evaluate to a callable object. All argument expressions are evaluated
before the call is attempted.

Power Operator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    power ::=  primary ['**' u_expr]


The power operator has the same semantics as the built-in pow function (not supported); it computes its
left argument raised to the power of its right argument. It binds more tightly than unary operators on the
left, but less tightly than unary operators on the right; i.e. ``-2 ** -3 == -(2 ** (-3))``.  The left and right
operands can be ``int``, ``float`` or ``Tensor``. Scalars are broadcast in the case of scalar-tensor/tensor-scalar
exponentiation operations, and tensor-tensor exponentiation is done elementwise without any broadcasting.

Unary and Arithmetic Bitwise Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    u_expr ::=  power | '-' power | '~' power

The unary ``-`` operator yields the negation of its argument. The unary ``~`` operator yields the bitwise inversion
of its argument. ``-`` can be used with ``int``, ``float``, and ``Tensor`` of ``int`` and ``float``.
``~`` can only be used with ``int`` and ``Tensor`` of ``int``.

Binary Arithmetic Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    m_expr ::=  u_expr | m_expr '*' u_expr | m_expr '@' m_expr | m_expr '//' u_expr | m_expr '/' u_expr | m_expr '%' u_expr
    a_expr ::=  m_expr | a_expr '+' m_expr | a_expr '-' m_expr

The binary arithmetic operators can operate on ``Tensor``, ``int``, and ``float``. For tensor-tensor ops, both arguments must
have the same shape. For scalar-tensor or tensor-scalar ops, the scalar is usually broadcast to the size of the
tensor. Division ops can only accept scalars as their right-hand side argument, and do not support broadcasting.
The ``@ ``operator is for matrix multiplication and only operates on ``Tensor`` arguments. The multiplication operator
(``*``) can be used with a list and integer in order to get a result that is the original list repeated a certain
number of times.

Shifting Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    shift_expr ::=  a_expr | shift_expr ( '<<' | '>>' ) a_expr


These operators accept two ``int`` arguments, two ``Tensor`` arguments, or a ``Tensor`` argument and an ``int`` or
``float`` argument. In all cases, a right shift by ``n`` is defined as floor division by ``pow(2, n)`` and a left shift
by ``n`` is defined as multiplication by ``pow(2, n)``. When both arguments are ``Tensors``, they must have the same
shape. When one is a scalar and the other is a ``Tensor``, the scalar is logically broadcast to match the size of
the ``Tensor``.

Binary Bitwise Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    and_expr ::=  shift_expr | and_expr '&' shift_expr
    xor_expr ::=  and_expr | xor_expr '^' and_expr
    or_expr  ::=  xor_expr | or_expr '|' xor_expr


The ``&`` operator computes the bitwise AND of its arguments, the ``^`` the bitwise XOR and ``|`` the bitwise OR.
Both operands must be ``int`` or ``Tensor``, or the left operand must be ``Tensor`` and the right operand must be
``int``. When both operands are ``Tensor``, they must have the same shape. When the right operand is ``int``, and
the left operand is ``Tensor`` , the right operand is logically broadcast to match the shape of the ``Tensor``.

Comparisons
^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    comparison    ::=  or_expr (comp_operator or_expr)*
    comp_operator ::=  '<' | '>' | '==' | '>=' | '<=' | '!=' | 'is' ['not'] | ['not'] 'in'

A comparison yields a boolean values (``True`` or ``False``) or, if one of the operands is a ``Tensor``, a boolean
``Tensor``. Comparisons can be chained arbitrarily as long as they do not yield boolean ``Tensors`` that have more
than one element. ``a op1 b op2 c ...`` is equivalent to ``a op1 b and b op2 c and ...``.

Value Comparisons
"""""""""""""""""
The operators ``<``, ``>``, ``==``, ``>=``, ``<=``, and ``!=`` compare the values of two objects. The two objects generally need to be of
the same type, unless there is an implicit type conversion available between the objects. User-defined types can
be compared if rich comparison methods ( ``__lt__`` etc.) are defined on them. Built-in type comparison works like
Python:

* numbers are compared mathematically
* strings are compared lexicographically
* lists, tuples, and dicts can be compared only to other lists, tuples, and dicts of the same type and are compared using the comparison operator of corresponding elements

Membership Test Operations
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The operators ``in`` and ``not in`` test for membership. ``x in s`` evaluates to ``True`` if ``x`` is a member of ``s`` and ``False```` otherwise.
``x not in s`` is equivalent to ``not x in s``. This operator is supported for lists, dicts, and tuples, and can be used with
user-defined types if they implement the ``__contains__`` method.

Identity Comparisons
""""""""""""""""""""
For all types except ``int``, ``double``, ``bool``, and ``torch.device``, operators ``is`` and ``is not`` test for the object’s identity;
``x is y`` is ``True`` if and and only if ``x`` and ``y`` are the same object. For all other types, ``is`` is equivalent to
comparing them using ``==``. ``x is not y`` yields the inverse of ``x is y``.

Boolean Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    or_test  ::=  and_test | or_test 'or' and_test
    and_test ::=  not_test | and_test 'and' not_test
    not_test ::=  'bool' '(' or_expr ')' | comparison | 'not' not_test

User-defined objects can customize their conversion to ``bool`` by implementing a ``__bool__`` method. The operator ``not``
yields ``True`` if its operand is false, ``False`` otherwise. The expression ``x`` and ``y`` first evaluates ``x``; if it is ``False``, its
value (``False``) is returned; otherwise, ``y`` is evaluated and its value is returned (``False`` or ``True``). The expression ``x`` or ``y``
first evaluates ``x``; if it is ``True``, its value (``True``) is returned; otherwise, ``y`` is evaluated and its value is returned
(``False`` or ``True``).

Conditional Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   conditional_expression ::=  or_expr ['if' or_test 'else' conditional_expression]
    expression            ::=  conditional_expression

The expression ``x if c else y`` first evaluates the condition ``c`` rather than x. If ``c`` is ``True``, ``x`` is
evaluated and its value is returned; otherwise, ``y`` is evaluated and its value is returned. As with if-statements,
``x`` and ``y`` must evaluate to a value of the same type.

Expression Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    expression_list ::=  expression (',' expression)* [',']
    starred_item    ::=  '*' primary

A starred item can only appear on the left-hand side of an assignment statement, e.g. ``a, *b, c = ...``.

::

    augmented_assignment_stmt ::= augtarget augop (expression_list)
    augtarget                 ::= identifier | attributeref | subscription
    augop                     ::= "+=" | "-=" | "*=" | "/=" | "//=" | "%=" |
                                  "**="| ">>=" | "<<=" | "&=" | "^=" | "|="

::

    annotated_assignment_stmt ::= augtarget ":" expression
                                  ["=" (starred_expression)]

Compound Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following section describes the syntax of compound statements that are supported in TorchScript.
The section also highlights how Torchscript differs from regular Python statements.
It is modeled after `the compound statements chapter of the Python language reference <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html>`_.

The ``if`` statement:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Torchscript supports both basic ``if/else`` and ternary ``if/else``.

Basic ``if/else`` statement:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

::

    if_stmt ::= "if" assignment_expression ":" suite
                ("elif" assignment_expression ":" suite)
                ["else" ":" suite]

* ``elif`` statement can repeat for arbitrary number of times, but it needs to be before ``else`` statement.

Ternary ``if/else`` statement:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

::

    if_stmt ::= return [expression_list] "if" assignment_expression "else" [expression_list]

**Example**

* ``Tensor`` with 1 dimension is promoted to ``bool``

.. testcode::

    import torch

    @torch.jit.script
    def fn(x: torch.Tensor):
        if x: # The tensor gets promoted to bool
            return True
        return False
    print(fn(torch.rand(1)))

.. testoutput::

    True

* ``Tensor`` with multi dimensions are not promoted to ``bool``

**Example**

::

    import torch

    # Multi dimensional Tensors error out.

    @torch.jit.script
    def fn():
        if torch.rand(2):
            print("Tensor is available")

        if torch.rand(4,5,6):
            print("Tensor is available")

    print(fn())

The above code results in the below RuntimeError

::

    RuntimeError: The following operation failed in the TorchScript interpreter.
    Traceback of TorchScript (most recent call last):
    @torch.jit.script
    def fn():
        if torch.rand(2):
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~ <--- HERE
            print("Tensor is available")
    RuntimeError: Boolean value of Tensor with more than one value is ambiguous

* If a conditional variable is annotated as Final, either true or false branch is
* evaluated depending on the evaluation of the conditional variable.

**Example**

::

    import torch

    a : torch.jit.final[Bool] = True

    if a:
        return torch.empty(2,3)
    else:
        return []

Here, only True branch is evaluated, since ``a`` is annotated as ``final`` and set to ``True``

The ``while`` statement:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    while_stmt ::=  "while" assignment_expression ":" suite

* `while...else` statements are not supported in Torchscript. It results in a `RuntimeError`

The ``for-in`` statement:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    for_stmt ::=  "for" target_list "in" expression_list ":" suite
                  ["else" ":" suite]

* ``for...else`` statements are not supported in Torchscript. It results in a ``RuntimeError``

* for loops on tuples: These unroll the loop, generating a body for each member of the tuple.The body must type-check correctly for each member.

**Example**

.. testcode::

    import torch
    from typing import Tuple

    @torch.jit.script
    def fn():
        tup = (3, torch.ones(4))
        for x in tup:
            print(x)

    fn()

.. testoutput::

    3
     1
     1
     1
     1
    [ CPUFloatType{4} ]


*  for loops on lists: For loops over a ``nn.ModuleList`` will unroll the body of the loop at compile time, with each member of the module list.

**Example**

::

    class SubModule(torch.nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super(SubModule, self).__init__()
            self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(2))

        def forward(self, input):
            return self.weight + input

    class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):

        def __init__(self):
            super(MyModule, self).init()
            self.mods = torch.nn.ModuleList([SubModule() for i in range(10)])

        def forward(self, v):
            for module in self.mods:
                v = module(v)
            return v

    model = torch.jit.script(MyModule())

The ``with`` statement:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* The ``with`` statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with methods defined by a context manager

::

    with_stmt ::=  "with" with_item ("," with_item) ":" suite
    with_item ::=  expression ["as" target]

* If a target was included in the ``with`` statement, the return value from context manager’s ``__enter__()``
* is assigned to it. Unlike python, if an exception caused the suite to be exited, its type, value, and traceback are
* not passed as arguments to ``__exit__()``. Three ``None`` arguments are supplied.

* ``try/except/finally`` statements are not supported inside ``with`` blocks.
*  Exceptions raised within ``with`` block cannot be suppressed.

The ``tuple`` statement:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    tuple_stmt ::= tuple([iterables])

* Iterable types in TorchScript include ``Tensors``, ``lists``,``tuples``, ``dictionaries``, ``strings``,``torch.nn.ModuleList`` and ``torch.nn.ModuleDict``.
* Cannot convert a List to Tuple by using this built-in function.
* Unpacking all outputs into a tuple is covered by:

::

    abc = func() # Function that returns a tuple
    a,b = func()

The ``getattr`` statement:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    getattr_stmt ::= getattr(object, name[, default])

* Attribute name must be a literal string.
* Module type object is not supported for example, torch._C
* Custom Class object is not supported for example, torch.classes.*

The ``hasattr`` statement:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    hasattr_stmt ::= hasattr(object, name)

* Attribute name must be a literal string.
* Module type object is not supported for example, torch._C
* Custom Class object is not supported for example, torch.classes.*

The ``zip`` statement:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    zip_stmt ::= zip(iterable1, iterable2)

* Arguments must be iterables.
* Two iterables of same outer container type but different length are supported.

**Example**

.. testcode::

    a = [1, 2] # List
    b = [2, 3, 4] # List
    zip(a, b) # works

* Both the iterables must be of the same container type - (List here).

**Example**

::

    a = (1, 2) # Tuple
    b = [2, 3, 4] # List
    zip(a, b) # Runtime error

The above code results in the below RuntimeError

::

    RuntimeError: Can not iterate over a module list or
        tuple with a value that does not have a statically determinable length.

* Two iterables of same container Type but different data type is supported

**Example**

.. testcode::

    a = [1.3, 2.4]
    b = [2, 3, 4]
    zip(a, b) # Works

* Iterable types in TorchScript include ``Tensors``, ``lists``, ``tuples``, ``dictionaries``, ``strings``, ``torch.nn.ModuleList`` and ``torch.nn.ModuleDict``.

The ``enumerate`` statement:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    enumerate_stmt ::= enumerate([iterable])

* Arguments must be iterables.
* Iterable types in TorchScript include ``Tensors``, ``lists``, ``tuples``, ``dictionaries``, ``strings``, ``torch.nn.ModuleList`` and ``torch.nn.ModuleDict``.


.. _python-values-torch-script:

Python Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _python-builtin-functions-values-resolution:

Resolution Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When given a Python value, TorchScript attempts to resolve it in following five different ways:

* Compilable Python Implementation:
    * When a Python value is backed by a Python implementation that can be compiled by TorchScript, TorchScript compiles and uses the underlying Python implementation.
    * Example: ``torch.jit.Attribute``
* Op Python Wrapper:
    * When a Python value is a wrapper of a native PyTorch op, TorchScript emits corresponding operator.
    * Example: ``torch.jit._logging.add_stat_value``
* Python Object Identity Match:
    * For a limited set of ``torch.*`` API calls (in the form of Python values) that TorchScript supports, TorchScript attempts to match a Python value against each item in the set.
    * When matched, TorchScript generates a corresponding ``SugaredValue`` instance that contains lowering logic for these values.
    * Example: ``torch.jit.isinstance()``
* Name Match:
    * For Python built-in functions and constants, TorchScript identifies them by name, and creates a corresponding SugaredValue instance that implements their functionality.
    * Example: ``all()``
* Value Snapshot:
    * For Python values from unrecognized modules, TorchScript attempts to take a snapshot of the value and converts to a constant in the graph of the function(s) or method(s) being compiled
    * Example: ``math.pi``

.. _torch_apis_in_torchscript:

``torch.*`` APIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _torch_apis_in_torchscript_rpc:

Remote Procedure Calls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TorchScript supports a subset of RPC APIs that supports running a function on
on a specified remote worker instead of locally.

Specifically, following APIs are fully supported:

- ``torch.distributed.rpc.rpc_sync()``
    - ``rpc_sync()`` makes a blocking RPC call to run a function on remote worker. RPC messages are sent and received in parallel to execution of Python code.
    - More deatils about its usage and examples can be found in :meth:`~torch.distributed.rpc.rpc_sync`.

- ``torch.distributed.rpc.rpc_async()``
    - ``rpc_async()`` makes a non-blocking RPC call to run a function on remote worker. RPC messages are sent and received in parallel to execution of Python code.
    - More deatils about its usage and examples can be found in :meth:`~torch.distributed.rpc.rpc_async`.
- ``torch.distributed.rpc.remote()``
    - Executing a remote call on worker and getting a Remote Reference ``RRef`` as return value.
    - More details about its usage and examples can be found in :meth:`~torch.distributed.rpc.remote`.

.. _torch_apis_in_torchscript_async:

Asynchronous Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TorchScript allows creating asynchronous computation tasks to make better use
of computation resources. This is done via supporting a list of APIs that are
only usable within TorchScript:

- ``torch.jit.fork()``
    - Creates an asynchronous task executing func and a reference to the value of the result of this execution. fork will return immediately.
    - Synonymous to ``torch.jit._fork()``, which is only kept for backward compatibility reasons.
    - More deatils about its usage and examples can be found in :meth:`~torch.jit.fork`.
- ``torch.jit.wait()``
    - Forces completion of a ``torch.jit.Future[T]`` asynchronous task, returning the result of the task.
    - Synonymous to ``torch.jit._wait()``, which is only kept for backward compatibility reasons.
    - More deatils about its usage and examples can be found in :meth:`~torch.jit.wait`.


.. _torch_apis_in_torchscript_annotation:

Type Annotations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TorchScript is statically-typed, it provides and supports a set of utilities to help annotate variables and attributes.:

- ``torch.jit.annotate()``
    - Provides a type hint to TorchScript where Python 3 style type hints do not work well.
    - One common example is to annotate type for expressions like ``[]``. ``[]`` is treated as ``List[torch.Tensor]`` by default, when a different type is needed, one can use following code to hint TorchScript: ``torch.jit.annotate(List[int], [])``.
    - More details can be found in :meth:`~torch.jit.annotate`
- ``torch.jit.Attribute``
    - Common use cases include providing type hint for ``torch.nn.Module`` attributes. Because their ``__init__`` methods are not parsed by TorchScript, ``torch.jit.Attribute`` should be used instead of ``torch.jit.annotate`` in module's ``__init__`` methods.
    - More details can be found in :meth:`~torch.jit.Attribute`
- ``torch.jit.Final``
    - An alias for Python's ``typing.Final``. ``torch.jit.Final`` is only kept for backward compatibility reasons.


.. _torch_apis_in_torchscript_meta_programming:

Meta Programming
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TorchScript provides a set of utilities to facilitate meta programming.

- ``torch.jit.is_scripting()``
    - Returns a boolean value indicating whether current program is compiled by ``torch.jit.script`` or not.
    - When used in an ``assert`` or ``if`` statement, the scope or branch where ``torch.jit.is_scripting()`` evaluates to ``False`` is not compiled.
    - Its value can be evaluated statically at compile time, thus commonly used in ``if`` statement to stop TorchScript from compiling one of the branches.
    - More details and examples can be found in :meth:`~torch.jit.is_scripting`
- ``@torch.jit.ignore``
    - This decorator indicates to the compiler that a function or method should be ignored and left as a Python function.
    - This allows you to leave code in your model that is not yet TorchScript compatible.
    - If a function decorated by ``@torch.jit.ignore`` is called from TorchScript, ignored functions will dispatch the call to the Python interpreter.
    - Models with ignored functions cannot be exported.
    - More details and examples can be found in :meth:`~torch.jit.ignore`
- ``@torch.jit.unused``
    - This decorator indicates to the compiler that a function or method should be ignored and replaced with the raising of an exception.
    - This allows you to leave code in your model that is not yet TorchScript compatible and still export your model.
    - If a function decorated by ``@torch.jit.unused`` is called from TorchScript, a runtime error will be raised.
    - More details and examples can be found in :meth:`~torch.jit.unused`

.. _torch_apis_in_torchscript_type_refinement:

Type Refinement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``torch.jit.isinstance()``
    - Returns a boolean indicating whether a variable is of specified type.
    - More deatils about its usage and examples can be found in :meth:`~torch.jit.isinstance`.
